/**
 * ProfileTokenStorageHost
 *
 * Internal "host" interface that the facade `ProfileTokenStorageProvider`
 * exposes to its sub-modules (`LifecycleManager`, `FlushScheduler`,
 * `BundleIndex`, `HistoryStore`). The sub-modules read shared state and
 * common helpers via this interface rather than holding direct references
 * to facade fields.
 *
 * The facade keeps the source of truth for cross-seam state:
 *   - `status`, `initialized`, `isShuttingDown`, `identity`,
 *     `encryptionKey` — lifecycle bits read by every sub-module.
 *   - `addressId`, `replicationUnsub` — owned by lifecycle but read by
 *     bundle/history paths to scope keys.
 *   - `pendingData`, `flushTimer`, `flushPromise`, `lastPinnedCid` — owned
 *     by flush scheduler but observed by `load()` (to await an in-flight
 *     flush) and `shutdown()` (to cancel + drain).
 *   - `knownBundleCids` — owned by bundle index but read by replication
 *     handler and `clear()`.
 *
 * The facade preserves byte-identical PUBLIC API (no signature changes,
 * no field renames). Tests reach into `provider.initialized` and
 * `provider.encryptionKey` via `as any`; those names live on the facade
 * unchanged.
