/**
 * OpLog envelope read/write helpers for ProfileDatabase-backed adapters.
 *
 * Issue #247 — multiple writers in the Profile layer historically wrote
 * raw AES-GCM ciphertext via `db.put(key, ciphertext)` while the lean-
 * snapshot reader pipeline (`ProfileLeanSnapshot.readAllKvEntries` →
 * `storage.getEncryptedRaw(key)` → `db.getEntry(key)` → `decodeEntry()`)
 * expected CBOR-encoded OpLog envelopes. Random IV-prefixed ciphertext
 * looks like garbage CBOR, producing varied per-write decode errors
 * (every write of the same key produces a different signature because
 * of the random IV).
 *
 * The decode failures were tolerated by the lean snapshot with a
 * `— skipping` warn, so the immediate failure was silent — but the
 * resulting snapshot was missing those keys → cross-device profile
 * sync was incomplete.
 *
 * This module centralises the canonical pattern used by
 * `ProfileStorageProvider.writeEnvelope` / `readEnvelopePayload`:
 *
 *   - Write: `putEntry` with a CBOR envelope wrapping the ciphertext.
 *     Fallback to raw `put` for adapters that don't implement
 *     `putEntry` (legacy stubs).
 *   - Read: `getEntry` with `trustLocalClaim: true`. If the entry is
 *     legacy (`v === 0` synthetic envelope), unwrap its payload.
 *     Backwards-compat fallback: when `getEntry` itself throws decode
 *     failure (raw bytes that aren't CBOR-encoded envelopes), fall back
 *     to `db.get(key)` for the raw ciphertext.
 *
 * Adapters use `cache_index` as the entry type — that's the canonical
 * system classification for internal book-keeping records (the only
 * three system entry types are `session_receipt`, `cache_index`, and
 * `last_opened_ts`; `cache_index` is the catch-all per the existing
 * pattern in `ProfileStorageProvider.writeEnvelope` /
 * `consolidation.addBundle`).
