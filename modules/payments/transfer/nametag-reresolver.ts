/**
 * Nametag re-resolver — UXF Inter-Wallet Transfer recipient (T.7.B.5 / C9).
 *
 * **Threat model.** `payload.sender.nametag` arrives on the wire as a
 * plaintext, attacker-controllable field of the outer envelope (§3.1).
 * The Nostr event's signing pubkey is verified by the relay and is the
 * only authenticated piece of sender identity at the wire layer; the
 * `sender.nametag` claim is NOT covered by `bundleCid` and NOT covered
 * by any signature we verify locally. A hostile sender SHIPPING from
 * pubkey `K_attacker` can therefore put ANY string (e.g. `"alice"`,
 * the victim's nametag) into `payload.sender.nametag` to mislead the
 * recipient's UI into displaying a forged identity.
 *
 * **Defense (§5.6, §9.3).** Before any UI-bound surface (`transfer:incoming`
 * payload, history entries, conversation/contact UIs), the recipient
 * MUST re-resolve the sender's nametag against the AUTHENTICATED Nostr
 * signing pubkey via the identity-binding-event registry
 * ({@link TransportProvider.resolveTransportPubkeyInfo}). The binding
 * event is itself signed by its claimed pubkey, so the binding-event
 * nametag is a cryptographically-attested statement by the binding
 * publisher (the only publisher who can publish for that pubkey, per
 * the relay's signature gate) — NOT a plaintext claim by an arbitrary
 * sender.
 *
 * **Decision rule.**
 *
 * | Scenario                                              | UI nametag                | source                  |
 * |-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
 * | Binding event found, has `nametag`                    | `binding.nametag`         | `'binding-event'`       |
 * | Binding event found, no `nametag` (pubkey-only bind)  | `null`                    | `'binding-event'`       |
 * | Binding lookup returns `null` (no binding registered) | `null`                    | `'untrusted-payload'`   |
 * | Binding lookup throws / transport unavailable         | `null`                    | `'untrusted-payload'`   |
 *
 * **Why we DEFAULT to `null` when the binding lookup fails.**
 *
 * The protocol's safety story rests on "never display a sender-supplied
 * nametag without re-resolution". If we surface `payload.sender.nametag`
 * whenever the binding lookup is inconclusive, we open the C9 attack on
 * exactly the network-partition / first-encounter / new-pubkey paths
 * that an adversary can RELIABLY trigger:
 *
 *   - A new attacker pubkey has no binding event by definition (the
 *     attacker can simply NOT publish one). Without re-resolver
 *     gating, the attacker's first DM trivially impersonates `@alice`.
 *   - A relay outage temporarily makes binding lookups fail. Without
 *     gating, an attacker timing their attack to a relay outage
 *     window (or DOSing the relay to create one) gets the same
 *     impersonation.
 *
 * The only safe default is: **no binding-attested nametag → no UI
 * nametag**. The recipient sees `null`, the UI typically renders the
 * pubkey or "Unknown sender", and the user has the chance to
 * out-of-band-verify.
 *
 * The `source: 'untrusted-payload'` discriminator is preserved on the
 * return value so DOWNSTREAM consumers MAY make an informed decision
 * (e.g. a debug-mode UI could display "claimed: @alice (UNVERIFIED)"
 * but production UIs MUST respect the `null` and not auto-trust).
 *
 * **What this module does NOT do.**
 *
 *   1. We do NOT verify that the binding event's `transportPubkey`
 *      matches the sender's signing pubkey *byte-for-byte*. The
 *      binding registry is queried BY signing pubkey
 *      ({@link TransportProvider.resolveTransportPubkeyInfo}), so the
 *      precondition is enforced by the registry contract — a binding
 *      event for some OTHER pubkey will simply not be returned.
 *      Verifying this here would re-implement the registry.
 *   2. We do NOT detect "binding nametag != payload nametag" as an
 *      anomaly. The binding-event nametag wins unconditionally; a
 *      mismatch is silently corrected. Surfacing the mismatch as an
 *      operator alert is a future enhancement (the protocol does not
 *      currently mandate it; mismatch is not a SECURITY violation —
 *      it's just the sender being lazy or out-of-date).
 *   3. We do NOT cache results. The transport's binding-event
 *      registry is responsible for caching its own lookups; doing it
 *      here would create a stale-cache TOCTOU between this module
 *      and `resolveTransportPubkeyInfo()`.
 *
 * Spec references:
 *   - §3.1   `UxfTransferPayloadBase.sender.nametag` is UNAUTHENTICATED.
 *   - §5.6   "Do NOT trust `sender.nametag` for UI display unless
 *            re-resolved against the Nostr signing pubkey."
 *   - §9.3   Recipient receives a UXF bundle from an unknown sender.

 * Re-resolve a sender's display nametag against the identity-binding

 *
 * **Contract.**
 *   - The binding event for `senderPubkey` (if any) wins.
 *   - The unauthenticated `payloadSenderNametag` is NEVER displayed
 *     directly; it is accepted as a parameter ONLY for two purposes:
 *       (a) downstream loggers that want to correlate the original
 *           claim with the resolved value (out-of-band of this
 *           function's return value);
 *       (b) future telemetry that flags "binding != payload" as a
 *           potential adversarial signal.
 *   - If the binding lookup fails for ANY reason (no binding,
 *     transport returns `null`, the optional method is not
 *     implemented, the call throws), this function returns
 *     `{nametag: null, source: 'untrusted-payload'}`.
 *
 * **Inputs.**
 *   - `senderPubkey` — the AUTHENTICATED Nostr signing pubkey
 *                      (verified by the relay). 64-hex-char string.
 *   - `payloadSenderNametag` — the unauthenticated `payload.sender.nametag`
 *                              claim from the wire envelope (or
 *                              `undefined` if the sender omitted it).
 *                              Accepted but NEVER trusted; see contract.
 *   - `transport` — a {@link NametagResolver} (typically
 *                   `this.deps.transport`).
 *
 * **Output.** Always defined; `nametag` may be `null`.
 *
 * **Failure handling.** This function NEVER throws. Errors thrown by
 * `resolveTransportPubkeyInfo` are caught and translated to
 * `source: 'untrusted-payload'` because the safety contract requires
 * a graceful "no nametag" fallback (the caller is on a UI emission
 * path; throwing here would either crash the UI or force every
 * caller to wrap in try/catch).
 *
 * @param senderPubkey - The authenticated Nostr signing pubkey of
 *                       the bundle sender (NOT the unauthenticated
 *                       `payload.sender.transportPubkey`).
 * @param payloadSenderNametag - The unauthenticated nametag claim
 *                               from the wire envelope, accepted but
 *                               never trusted.
