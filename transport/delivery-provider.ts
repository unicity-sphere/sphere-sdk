/**
 * transport/delivery-provider.ts — the `DeliveryProvider` port (sdk-changes S7,
 * covenant §3.1-6).
 *
 * The seam that keeps the delivery rail swappable. In Unicity, a transfer —
 * after certification — is just a file handoff, so the port is deliberately
 * tiny: hand a finished token blob to a recipient, pull incoming deliveries,
 * acknowledge them. `WalletApiMailboxProvider`
 * (impl/shared/wallet-api/WalletApiMailboxProvider.ts) is the reference
 * implementation; anything that can move a file can implement it (the port
 * shape must not preclude the old Nostr transport or a future federated
 * transport — neither is a deliverable here).
 *
 * Normative shapes (sdk-changes S7):
 * - `DeliveryReceipt = { deliveryId }`
 * - `IncomingDelivery = { deliveryId, transferId?, senderPubkey?, memo?,
 *   fetchBlob(), cursor }`
 * - `deliveryId` is the **content-derived** entry id —
 *   `hex(SHA-256(tokenId bytes ‖ stateHash bytes))` — NEVER a server-assigned
 *   row id or seq (covenant §3.1-4; the contract suite asserts it). It is
 *   computed client-side ({@link computeDeliveryId}) and must equal the
 *   backend's `entry_id` (ARCHITECTURE §6).
 * - **Custody is a composition-time property, not a per-call flag**:
 *   implementations take `custody: 'inventory' | 'external'` at construction
 *   and every ack sends the corresponding `intoInventory` — delivery-only
 *   safety must never depend on remembering an option at a call site.
 * - Implementations MUST keep a **persistent `(tokenId, stateHash)` seen-set**
 *   for incoming deliveries: the recipient-side replay guard is part of the
 *   port contract, not a server promise (the recipient never trusts the
 *   backend — ARCHITECTURE §8.2). `deliveryId` is the canonical hash encoding
 *   of exactly that pair, so a persistent deliveryId set satisfies this.
